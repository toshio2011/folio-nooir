# Folio Nooir 1.6.3 Audit Notes

Research-only notes for the 1.6.3 development line. These findings are intended to make the next Codex implementation session start from verified questions instead of rediscovering context. No production code change is authorized by this document.

## 2026-09-18 — flash/headroom source audit

### Confirmed source findings

1. **Built-in fonts are a primary measurement target, not yet a proven saving.**
   `lib/EpdFont/builtinFonts/` contains generated built-in font payloads for Arabic, Noto Sans, Noto Serif and Ubuntu across multiple sizes/styles. Individual generated headers are large, but source/header size must never be reported as firmware saving. Only the linked `gh_release` ELF/map and resulting `firmware.bin` delta count.
2. **Do not remove Arabic/Quran fallback blindly.**
   Arabic/Quran rendering is a released, physically validated compatibility boundary. Any font experiment must first identify which built-in faces/sizes are actually linked and which paths require them. Preserve fallback and shaping behavior.
3. **Translation trimming already has infrastructure.**
   The repository's i18n generation path includes a `--strip-unused` mechanism. This is a low-risk measurement candidate before deleting languages or changing user-visible translation coverage. Verify exactly how the release build invokes generation before enabling/changing anything.
4. **OPDS is not a greenfield feature.**
   The repository already contains `lib/OpdsParser/OpdsParser.cpp/.h`. The parser includes bounded feed parsing concepts such as navigation/acquisition entries, search-template handling and pagination links. The next task is to trace whether the activity/UI/network/download/persistence path is currently wired and reachable, then classify each missing piece. Do not describe OPDS as simply absent until that reconciliation is complete.
5. **Bluetooth also has inherited scaffolding.**
   `src/BleInput.cpp/.h` exists and wraps FreeInk BLE HID-host behavior, including teardown/release behavior. The normal production path still needs to be traced to determine compile/link reachability and what FreeInk capabilities are actually enabled. Bluetooth remains experimental: do not enable it in normal firmware before exact flash/RAM/heap measurements.
6. **Existing build optimization must be inventoried before proposing duplicates.**
   Nooir already contains selective/disabled component choices and size-oriented configuration. The linker/map audit should distinguish code that exists in the tree from code that is actually linked into `gh_release`.

### Important interpretation

The current flash-recovery hypothesis is **font/generated-data/link reachability first**, but nothing has yet proved how many bytes can be recovered. The goal of the next build-capable session is measurement, not deletion.

## Work that can continue without Codex/local builds

Research can continue safely while no build-capable Codex session is available:

- trace the exact built-in font registry and every reference to Arabic/Noto/Ubuntu faces;
- trace `--strip-unused` from generator to PlatformIO/release build invocation;
- trace OPDS parser callers, UI/activity wiring, network/TLS/download path, settings/persistence and library refresh;
- trace `BleInput` callers and compile guards, then identify which FreeInk BLE objects/libraries would become linked if enabled;
- inspect hyphenation generated data and lookup paths;
- inspect theme/assets/web resources for compile/link reachability;
- compare current CrossPoint/CrossInk/InkPointX/CrossPDF/CrossLink implementations and record exact commits/PRs worth revisiting;
- identify likely linker symbols/object files to look for later, so the map audit has a checklist.

Research findings must be labeled **confirmed source fact**, **upstream observation**, or **hypothesis requiring build measurement**.

## Next build-capable/Codex plan

When Codex/local build access returns:

1. **Freeze the comparison point.** Confirm branch/HEAD and reproduce normal `gh_release` before modifying source. Compare against the released 1.6.2 measurements already recorded in the backlog.
2. **Produce map evidence.** Preserve the ELF/map/size output and rank linked contributors by object/symbol/category: fonts, hyphenation, i18n, themes/assets, web/network/TLS, image decoders, inherited features.
3. **Run one-variable experiments.** Build baseline, then independently test candidates such as unused-i18n stripping, safe built-in-font reductions/move-to-SD ideas, hyphenation representation/reduction and unreachable inherited feature removal. Revert between experiments.
4. **Record exact deltas.** For every experiment record linked flash, padded `firmware.bin`, app-slot margin, static RAM and—where runtime behavior is touched—free heap/largest block.
5. **Keep only evidence-backed wins.** No partition enlargement. No Arabic/Quran, pagination, cache-format, KOSync, image-quality or recovery regression for flash savings.
6. **Only after headroom recovery**, resume the wider 1.6.3 sequence: upstream EPUB/font/image memory deltas, SD/SPI benchmark, small safe fixes, then measured feature prototypes.

## Map-audit checklist for the next session

Search the release map/ELF for:
- built-in Arabic/Noto Sans/Noto Serif/Ubuntu font symbols and registry tables;
- hyphenation trie/data symbols;
- i18n tables/strings that survive release linking;
- OPDS parser/UI/network symbols;
- BLE/FreeInk HID host symbols;
- theme-specific renderers and compiled image/icon assets;
- web server/static assets;
- TLS/WolfSSL objects;
- JPEG/PNG/CBZ decoder objects;
- duplicate or unexpectedly retained activities.

Do not infer linked cost from repository file size. The map and normal release binary are authoritative.
